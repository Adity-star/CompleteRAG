# Complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Complete RAG** repository! This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** from scratch. RAG is a powerful framework that combines the strengths of **retrieval-based** and **generation-based** models to improve natural language generation (NLG) tasks by incorporating external knowledge through retrieval mechanisms.

This guide walks you through each stage of building a RAG system, from data collection and preprocessing to training and evaluation. Whether youâ€™re new to RAG or looking to refine your implementation, this repository provides all the tools, concepts, and code necessary.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid approach that combines **retrieval-based models** with **generation-based models** to produce better, more informative responses. It allows a model to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of documents and use that information to generate more accurate, contextually aware outputs. RAG models are particularly useful in tasks like **question answering**, **dialog systems**, and **open-domain text generation**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Retrieval**: The model retrieves relevant passages or documents from an external knowledge base.
- **Generation**: The model generates text based on the retrieved information.
- **End-to-End Training**: RAG models can be trained end-to-end, where both the retrieval and generation components are jointly optimized.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval Process**: Given a query or input, the retrieval component of RAG searches a large corpus or knowledge base to find relevant documents.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the model's understanding of the query.
3. **Generation**: A generative model, often a transformer-based architecture (e.g., T5, BART), uses the augmented information to generate an output.

This dual mechanism improves the performance of generative models by leveraging external knowledge for better context and accuracy.
